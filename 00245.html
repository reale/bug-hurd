 Ok, so it looks like every process maintains it&#39;s own set of queues.  So
I am a server process and I setup 3 queues for clients to write in.  Now,
how do the clients know where to write the data so I can find it?  Previously,
you said it would be the memory managers job.  So, I write to some pre-defined
queue of the memory manager, to say people can write msg&#39;s to me.  Now, any
process can ask the memory manager where to put msg&#39;s to me.  If this is what
you are thinking, it sort of makes sense.  But assumming we have a process/task
boundary where each process has it&#39;s own virtual address space how can it break
this barrier without the kernel&#39;s help?  I can sort of wrap my brain around
this,
but I keep comming back to crazy libc hacks.
