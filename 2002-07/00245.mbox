 Ok, so it looks like every process maintains it's own set of queues.  So
I am a server process and I setup 3 queues for clients to write in.  Now,
how do the clients know where to write the data so I can find it?  Previously,
you said it would be the memory managers job.  So, I write to some pre-defined
queue of the memory manager, to say people can write msg's to me.  Now, any
process can ask the memory manager where to put msg's to me.  If this is what
you are thinking, it sort of makes sense.  But assumming we have a process/task
boundary where each process has it's own virtual address space how can it break
this barrier without the kernel's help?  I can sort of wrap my brain around
this,
but I keep comming back to crazy libc hacks.
