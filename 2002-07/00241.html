&gt; But how much performance imprevement would we achieve if we created such
&gt; a mechanism, only for pure data?

The fastest way to do it that I can imagine, for the simplest case of
mutually trusting processes, is to have a (possibly) short message
queue, protected by a mutex and some condition variables, all in th
eshared memory page. It&#39;s not obvious to me if that will be slower or
faster than L4 ipc that can pass the data in registers.

Furthermore, I have never implemented mutexes and condition variables,
but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some syscall is needed for conditions
to propagate between threads or processes.
