You are right, but we need the kernel's help only once during the whole
process' lifetime, i.e. when the new process is created and the shared 
memory area chosen by the memory manager.  During the process creation,
the address of this area could be written in some well-known location
of the process' address space.  This way there's no need for the process
itself to query the memory manager each time it wants to send a message.
