Hi,

&gt; here is a tiny patch which corrects a couple of typos in the ext2fs
&gt; translator.

Thanks a lot for telling us about these typos.

IIRC typos will get fixed when someone works on this part of the
code.  IIRC someone had a list of typos (Marcus?).  Perhaps Ognyan can
change this in his patch...

Thanks,
Marco
