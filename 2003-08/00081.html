  <pre>  Hi,

  I have made a new pre-release (0.02) of my translator for the MINIX
file system (actually a modified version of the Ext2 translator).
As several major bugs have been fixed, especially in the directory-
handling code, the new release should work far better than the previous
one, although it is still very unstable and crash-prone.
  Many things need to be done; among them (from the README):

o rewriting such parts as are inherent to the Ext2 file system and only
  by dint of ugly botch-works have been adapted to the MINIX fs;

o polishing the code and commenting it in a more orderly manner (many
  functions have comments which are but relics of the Ext2 code);

o rewriting the Makefile;

o re-implementing better inode- and zone-allocation policies (in simplifying
  the algorithms used by the Ext2 translator, I made them probably less
  efficient);

o devising a good solution to the problem of conciliating the limitations
  of the MINIX file system with the needs of the GNU OS, without hindering
  compatibility with other environments;

o writing some documentation on the MINIX file system itself;

o developing a simple test suite.

  The code of the translator is available at

P.S.: I am compelled to ask again a question which I think is of some
consequence, to wit:
I have some perplexities about the proper way, in which one should
update the copyright notice.  I have added a comment to each heading, to
explain the the code has been modified by me, but have left unchanged the
remainder, being uncertain whether I should update the copyright year too.
For example,

*** ext2fs/dir.c	Sun Jul 20 20:16:37 2003
--- minixfs/dir.c	Sun Jul 20 20:16:44 2003
