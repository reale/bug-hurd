I'll try to roughly explain my idea, which doesn't apply
to every IPC type, but only to a small subset thereof. This 
subset includes the message passing between a client/server
pair and among the servers themselves, with the additional
constraint of very small pieces of data being passed at once.
In this scenario we could use one (or even more) system-wide
data structure, such as a queue, to manage all the messages.
This queue would be made up of several smaller queues, each
one pertaining to a single process (or group of processes)
and used by this process to talk with one or more servers.
Each small queue would live in one page (or more, but few, pages)
or memory shared with the servers. One possible (simplified)
arrangement of the memory would look like this:

  process #1        process #2        process #3

Sorry for the lack of clearness, but my idea - and for that matter
my English - are alas at early alpha stage. I'd like, however,
to hear your criticism and hopefully your suggestions.

Thanks,
Roberto
