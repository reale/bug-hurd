  <pre>  Hi,

  I&#39;ve made a new release (0.03) of the MINIX fs translator at which
I&#39;m working (a modified version of the Ext2 translator, actually).  It
still lacks good stability, yet some very nasty bugs (and very silly
ones, too, which I myself introduced during the process of adapting
the Ext2 code) have been fixed and, although very fitfully, it appears
to work.

  As one would expect of an alpha release, the code still needs a good
deal of polishing and revising.  If you would like to cast a glance at
it, and perhaps also try it, I shall be glad to receive suggestions,
criticism and especially bug reports.

  The translator is available at

  Thanks,
