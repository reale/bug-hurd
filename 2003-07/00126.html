They were ported already, by Guillem Jover. The patch is merged in debian
package (in unstable):

http://packages.debian.org/util-linux

It is actualy contained in the util-linux_*.diff.gz file. If someone has
time to, it&#39;d be nice to update it for latest upstream version of util-linux
and send it to the upstream maintainers.
