  <pre>Hi,

  I am studying the Hurd and, as an exercise, have modified the ext2fs
translator and adapted it to the MINIX file system.  This project is far
from being finished, and, as yet, very little of the new translator does
work.
  Large portions of code are pretty confused and shall be rewritten, on
account of some deep differences between the two file systems: for instance,
the directory entries are of a fixed size in MINIX, hence the directory
handling routines can be simplified and rewritten in a more ``natural&#39;&#39;
way.
  Of course, I will continue working at the translator, and will start in
time a porting of the two utilities `mkfs.minix&#39; and `fsck.minix&#39; from
`util-linux&#39;.
  Although pretty useless now, the current version of the translator is
to be found at

  http://paideia.sourceforge.net/hurd-minixfs-0.01.tar.gz

Thanks,
Roberto Reale

P.S.:  I have some perplexities about the proper way, in which one should
update the copyright notice.  I have added a comment to each heading, to
explain the the code has been modified by me, but have left unchanged the
remainder, being uncertain whether I should update the copyright year too.
For example,

*** ext2fs/dir.c	Sun Jul 20 20:16:37 2003
--- minixfs/dir.c	Sun Jul 20 20:16:44 2003
