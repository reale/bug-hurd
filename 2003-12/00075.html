&gt; &gt; Did you manage to fix those bugs you spoke about and are you still
&gt; &gt; interested in making this translator to work properly?
&gt; 
&gt;   To be sure I am interested in making my translator work properly!
&gt; Indeed, I have been working at a new revision, which is now
&gt; half-finished.  Several bugs have been fixed, but I have not done very
&gt; much testing, so others are likely to have escaped my search.
&gt; However, the translator does appear to work.

Good!  I&#39;m looking forward to the release.

&gt;   Regrettably, during the last four or five weeks I have been fairly
&gt; busy, so my ``development pace&#39;&#39; has slackened somewhat.  Anyway, the
&gt; new revision should be ready in a month or so.

Nice.

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately I&#39;m quite busy at the moment.  I can have a look at your
&gt; &gt; code in a about a month.  If one of the Hurd maintainers wants to
&gt; &gt; include minixfs in the Hurd I can help with this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I also wrote an (unreleased, unfinished) minixfs implementation, we
&gt; &gt; can have a look which one of these two is the best and use that.
&gt; 
&gt;   I should be glad to have your opinion and advice.  If you deem it
&gt; expedient, we might pick up from our implementations the best ideas
&gt; and merge them together, thus making the most of both your work and
&gt; mine.

I will have a look at your code when you release it.  I won&#39;t have
time next month, but you said it will take a month anyway.

&gt;   Thank you very much for your interest in my work.

Thank you for doing this work!
