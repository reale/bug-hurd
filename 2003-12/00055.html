Hi,

I&#39;m really sorry about the late reply. (Thanks for reminding me
Alfred!)

&gt;   I&#39;ve made a new release (0.03) of the MINIX fs translator at which
&gt; I&#39;m working (a modified version of the Ext2 translator, actually).  It
&gt; still lacks good stability, yet some very nasty bugs (and very silly
&gt; ones, too, which I myself introduced during the process of adapting
&gt; the Ext2 code) have been fixed and, although very fitfully, it appears
&gt; to work.

Did you manage to fix those bugs you spoke about and are you still
interested in making this translator to work properly?

&gt;   As one would expect of an alpha release, the code still needs a good
&gt; deal of polishing and revising.  If you would like to cast a glance at
&gt; it, and perhaps also try it, I shall be glad to receive suggestions,
&gt; criticism and especially bug reports.
&gt; 
&gt;   The translator is available at
&gt; 
&gt; http://paideia.sourceforge.net/index.html
&gt; http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/paideia/hurd-minixfs-0.03.tar.gz?download

Unfortunately I&#39;m quite busy at the moment.  I can have a look at your
code in a about a month.  If one of the Hurd maintainers wants to
include minixfs in the Hurd I can help with this.

I also wrote an (unreleased, unfinished) minixfs implementation, we
can have a look which one of these two is the best and use that.

Marcus, what do you think?

Thanks,
Marco
