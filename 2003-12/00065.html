  To be sure I am interested in making my translator work properly!
Indeed, I have been working at a new revision, which is now
half-finished.  Several bugs have been fixed, but I have not done very
much testing, so others are likely to have escaped my search.
However, the translator does appear to work.

  Regrettably, during the last four or five weeks I have been fairly
busy, so my ``development pace&#39;&#39; has slackened somewhat.  Anyway, the
new revision should be ready in a month or so.

&gt; Unfortunately I&#39;m quite busy at the moment.  I can have a look at your
&gt; code in a about a month.  If one of the Hurd maintainers wants to
&gt; include minixfs in the Hurd I can help with this.
&gt; 
&gt; I also wrote an (unreleased, unfinished) minixfs implementation, we
&gt; can have a look which one of these two is the best and use that.

  I should be glad to have your opinion and advice.  If you deem it
expedient, we might pick up from our implementations the best ideas
and merge them together, thus making the most of both your work and
mine.

  Thank you very much for your interest in my work.
